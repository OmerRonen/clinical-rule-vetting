Task: Doctors from PECARN collected data on around 43,000 patients, all under age 18, who reported head trauma. The study was conducted at 25 pediatric emergency department across the United States from June, 2004 to September, 2006. Given that CT scans and other treatments can cause long-term adverse effects, especially in young children, this task aims to propose intensive treatments only to those patients for whom it is truly necessary. The updated and improved clinical decision rule (using a l1-regularized logistic regression model) may be used in emergency departments in this way: on-site physicians can record around 100 features of the patient (including patient history, injury mechanism, symptoms, and more) into our model (model_best.py), which will then output a determination of whether the patient has a clinically important traumatic brain injury or not. Note this determination should serve as a recommendation based on data from previous cases, but every case is unique.

> 
> Study objective: The overall objective of this study is to develop a clinical decision rule for appropriate neuroimaging of children after minor-to-moderate head trauma. The goal of the study is to create a decision rule which identifies those children in need of emergent imaging (i.e. CT scan) and treatment, while reducing the use of head CT scans in those children with minimal risk of traumatic brain injuries.
